# My First Game - Ball Rolling Game

A small self made game for my first time using Unity. This game is your usual rolling ball game, where obstacles will show up suddenly and you have to dodge it.
If you do hit the obstacle, your health will be minus by 1.

### Bugs

There are still many bugs and lacks in this first edit, such as :
* Delta time for each obstacle to show up is too long.
* When obstacle is hit, there is no physical effect.
* No sound effect.
* Only one ball type (cannot change player).
* The road is not infinity.
* No leaderboard.
